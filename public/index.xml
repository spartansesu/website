      <description>The group uses 2 different key methods to communicate with the carers of young people within the group. The first is the use of e-mail through Online Scout Manager, software which the group uses for handling personal data and general Scouting admin. An account should be set up as part of the joining process.
The second method is through a Facebook group. This is where we share images from camps and activities as well as news about up coming meeting changes or activities.</description>
