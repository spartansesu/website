We are a group based in the Gospel Oak Community Centre attached to St Michael's Church in Hall Green, Birmingham. The group provides opportunities to learn, explore and develop skills for life for boys and girls from any background aged between 6 to 18 years old. We love to help young people discover things they never realised they could do, whether it is facing fears or learning new skills.

The group consists of:
* Beavers (ages 6 to 8)
* Cubs (ages 8 to 10.5)
* Scouts (ages 10.5 to 14)
* Explorers (ages 14 to 18)

We meet on Tuesdays during the school term from 18:30 to 20:00 for the Beavers, Cubs and Scouts. The Explorers meet on Tuesdays during the school term from 20:15 to 21:15. We also all meet up on different days for special events such as outings, fund raising events and camps. 

We are always happy for more volunteers to join our team in any capacity which you are able to help. This can be helping with making teas and coffees, being part of the executive committee or part of the leader team. 

If you are wanting to find out more, please e-mail or call the lead volunteer, Raksha.
