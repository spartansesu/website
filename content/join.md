## Young Person

The first step to joining is to contact Raksha for Beavers, Cubs and Scouts or Skip for Explorers. Their contact details are on the home page. We will answer any questions and would appreciate if you could give us any information regarding your young person's history. We have many young people in the group with different needs and it is better for all if these are known ahead of time. 

Your young person will be invited to join us on one of the Tuesday meetings and looked after by a member of the group. The cost for this session will be free. You will need to provide your name and an emergancy contact number. If you want to stay then you are more than welcome to.

If your young person loves it and wants to come back then please come back to the next Tuesday session. Please be ready to provide the following information:

* Young person's full name
* Young person's date of birth
* Your name
* Your e-mail address if applicable
* Your phone number

If you are not able to provide an e-mail address, we will ask for additional emergency contacts. Once this information has been provided, you should expect an e-mail from our membership management system called Online Scout Manager. There will be a link which enables you to create an account and fill in additional details about your young person. 

We will also ask you to fill in a gift aid form. As we are a charity, gift aid helps us get more money from your subs and activity fees. We have previously used the money we have got from gift aid to take the group on trips to West Midlands safari park or to offset the costs of camps in the Forest of Dean. 

## Adults

We always welcome help whether it is on occasion or weekly. Membership of the Scout Association as an adult involves a similar process to young people joining but with some more forms to fill in. In addition to the young person process, a Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) check will need to be completed. If this is successful, there will be some basic training to be completed covering:

* [Essential Information](https://www.scouts.org.uk/volunteers/learning-development-and-awards/training/learners/modules/getting-started-training/essential-information/)
* [Safety](https://www.scouts.org.uk/volunteers/learning-development-and-awards/training/learners/modules/ongoing-training-for-all/safety-training/)
* [Safeguarding](https://www.scouts.org.uk/volunteers/learning-development-and-awards/training/learners/modules/ongoing-training-for-all/safeguarding/)
* [GDPR](https://www.scouts.org.uk/volunteers/learning-development-and-awards/training/learners/modules/getting-started-training/gdpr-training/)

There may be a need to complete further training based on the role which you wish to hold but this will be covered in the introductionary chat.
