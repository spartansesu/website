The Scouts are an uniformed organisation and so it is expected that all members of the group will wear uniform. Each section has a different jumper or shirt to wear. Uniform can be bought from the following places:

- [Scouts Shop](https://shop.scouts.org.uk/uniforms)
- [The Scout Shop at Rough Close camp site](https://roughclose.chessck.co.uk)
- [Online from Rough Close Scout Shop](https://badgesandthings.co.uk)
- [eBay](https://ebay.co.uk)
